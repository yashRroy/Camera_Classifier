# Camera Classifier

**Camera Classifier** is a real-time image classification desktop application built using Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, and a simple machine learning classifier (default: Linear SVM). It enables users to capture images from their webcam, label them, train a model, and classify objects in real time—all within a lightweight graphical interface.
